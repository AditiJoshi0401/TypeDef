# TypeDef : Fun DS Games

ðŸ‘‰ Typedef is collection of games and programs made using the knowledge of Data Structures.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ These games are based on real world situations and problems thus connecting theory knowledge with real world application.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ The aim while creating such games was to apply our programming knowledge to mimic existing applications and solving problems.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ TypeDef currently has 4 sub-games : Wordle, Music Playlist Maker, Tower of Hanoi Solver and Family Tree Simulator.
